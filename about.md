## Server Information

Gamerland: Source is a unique Team Fortress 2 server group that has gone through a lot of changes in the past few years. But we are here to stay for as long as this cruel, technological world will let us.
We are a wacky TF2 server with differing plugins such as bunnyhop, RTD, friendly, and many more! We're more than happy to welcome you to our community if you wish to join.
